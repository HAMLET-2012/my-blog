 Let's work through some problems involving percentages. I'll describe each problem and then provide the solution with explanations.

Problem 1: Finding the Percentage of a Number
Problem Description:
What is 20% of 150?

Solution Approach:
To find the percentage of a number, multiply the number by the percentage (expressed as a decimal).

Calculation:
20
%
 of 
150
=
150
×
0.20
=
30
20% of 150=150×0.20=30

So, 20% of 150 is 30.

Problem 2: Percentage Increase
Problem Description:
A product's price increased from $50 to $60. What is the percentage increase?

Solution Approach:
To find the percentage increase, subtract the original price from the new price, divide by the original price, and multiply by 100.

Calculation:
Percentage Increase
=
(
60
−
50
50
)
×
100
=
(
10
50
)
×
100
=
20
%
Percentage Increase=( 
50
60−50
​
 )×100=( 
50
10
​
 )×100=20%

So, the price increased by 20%.

Problem 3: Percentage Decrease
Problem Description:
A product's price decreased from $80 to $64. What is the percentage decrease?

Solution Approach:
To find the percentage decrease, subtract the new price from the original price, divide by the original price, and multiply by 100.

Calculation:
Percentage Decrease
=
(
80
−
64
80
)
×
100
=
(
16
80
)
×
100
=
20
%
Percentage Decrease=( 
80
80−64
​
 )×100=( 
80
16
​
 )×100=20%

So, the price decreased by 20%.

Problem 4: Finding the Original Price Before Increase
Problem Description:
After a 15% increase, the price of a product is $92. What was the original price?

Solution Approach:
Let the original price be 
�
x. After a 15% increase, the new price is 
�
+
0.15
�
=
1.15
�
x+0.15x=1.15x. Set this equal to the new price and solve for 
�
x.

Calculation:
1.15
�
=
92
1.15x=92
�
=
92
1.15
x= 
1.15
92
​
 
x \approx 80 \

So, the original price was $80.

Problem 5: Finding the Original Price Before Decrease
Problem Description:
After a 25% decrease, the price of a product is $75. What was the original price?

Solution Approach:
Let the original price be 
�
x. After a 25% decrease, the new price is 
�
−
0.25
�
=
0.75
�
x−0.25x=0.75x. Set this equal to the new price and solve for 
�
x.

Calculation:
0.75
�
=
75
0.75x=75
�
=
75
0.75
x= 
0.75
75
​
 
�
=
100
x=100

So, the original price was $100.

Problem 6: Finding the Percentage of a Total
Problem Description:
A student scored 45 marks out of 60 in a test. What percentage did the student score?

Solution Approach:
To find the percentage, divide the score by the total marks and multiply by 100.

Calculation:
Percentage
=
(
45
60
)
×
100
=
75
%
Percentage=( 
60
45
​
 )×100=75%

So, the student scored 75%.

Problem 7: Finding the Part from Percentage
Problem Description:
25% of a number is 50. What is the number?

Solution Approach:
Let the number be 
�
x. Then, 
0.25
�
=
50
0.25x=50. Solve for 
�
x.

Calculation:
0.25
�
=
50
0.25x=50
�
=
50
0.25
x= 
0.25
50
​
 
�
=
200
x=200

So, the number is 200.
